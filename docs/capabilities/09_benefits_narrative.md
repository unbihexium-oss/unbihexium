## Return on Investment Analysis

### Cost-Benefit Framework

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):

$$
\text{TCO} = C_{license} + C_{compute} + C_{integration} + C_{training} + C_{maintenance}
$$

Return on Investment:

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Benefits} - \text{Costs}}{\text{Costs}} \times 100\%
$$

Net Present Value:

$$
\text{NPV} = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{B_t - C_t}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

Where $r$ is the discount rate and $t$ is the time period.
